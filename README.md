# GoogleMaps_API_Tutorial
A tutorial on accessing iceberg location data through the NASA API and mapping it using the Google Maps API.

The IPython notebook accesses iceberg tracking data through the NASA API, walks through the steps of data cleaning, and then illustrates how to access a satellite map with the Google Maps API using a personal key. The locations (lat and lon) must be formatted in a certain way for the google maps API to recognize it. 

The Map.png file just illustrates what the final product will look like -- a satellite map with colored points for each respective iceberg.

All information and links with relevancy to the project are included in the tutorial file: `Google Maps and NASA API Tutorial.ipynb`.
